# Deconstruct Dating Apps

Apply forensic analysis to modern romance and dating culture, exposing the algorithmic absurdity, transactional nature, and impossible expectations of finding love through digital platforms.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

This skill must NEVER:
- Mock people for using dating apps (most people do)
- Shame people for wanting connection or companionship
- Present finding love as easy or judge those who struggle
- Punch down at people's vulnerabilities or insecurities
- Reduce people to their dating profiles

The humor targets the systems and absurdities of app-based dating, not the people trying to find connection.

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you encounter:
- Dating advice or relationship content
- Discussions about modern romance
- Content about finding partners or compatibility
- Conversations about communication in relationships
- Topics involving dating apps, online dating, or digital connection
- Content about authenticity, vulnerability, or intimacy

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `content` | Yes | Dating or relationship content to transform | "Finding someone on dating apps is tough." |
| `specific_app` | No | Particular app to reference | "Hinge, Bumble, Tinder" |
| `dating_aspect` | No | Specific aspect to focus on | "profiles, matching, messaging" |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Dating Premise

What's the surface claim or observation about dating, connection, or finding a partner?

**Example:** "It's hard to find someone compatible on dating apps."

### Step 2: Locate the Systemic Absurdity

What's absurd about the mechanism itself? How does the app structure create impossible situations or reduce complexity to algo-rithms?

**Common absurdities:**
- Summarizing yourself in photos and prompts
- Algorithmic matchmaking based on superficial data
- Swiping as consumer choice
- Profile optimization as personality marketing
- Manufactured spontaneity
- Curated authenticity

**Example:** Dating apps require you to compress your entire personality into six photos and three prompts.

### Step 3: Create the Inappropriate Analogy

Compare the dating process to something transactional, professional, or absurdly reductive that highlights the absurdity.

**Common analogies:**
- Job applications/resumes
- Product marketing
- Consumer shopping
- Business transactions
- Performance reviews
- Advertising yourself

**Example:** "It's like creating a resume for someone to potentially tolerate you."

### Step 4: Add Specific Platform Details

Include specific app features, mechanics, or cultural phenomena that make it generationally precise.

**Specific details:**
- Swipe right/left
- Profile prompts ("two truths and a lie")
- Photo order strategizing
- Bio optimization
- Opening line pressure
- Read receipts
- Ghosting
- Breadcrumbing
- "We matched on [app]"

### Step 5: Expose the Vulnerability Underneath

End with the emotional truth—people want real connection but are forced into this absurd system.

**Example:** Wanting authentic love through an algorithm designed for user engagement, not compatibility.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content isn't about dating/relationships | Decline transformation |
| Already highly specific to dating culture | Enhance or skip |
| Becomes mean-spirited toward users | Refocus on system, not people |
| Too similar to existing examples | Create variation with different angle |

---

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Examples

### Example 1: Profile Creation

**Input:** "Creating a dating profile is challenging."

**Output:** "Dating apps want you to summarize your entire personality in six photos and three prompts. It's like creating a resume for someone to potentially tolerate you. And just like a resume, you're supposed to be authentic but also strategic. Vulnerable but not too vulnerable. Funny but not trying too hard. Be yourself—the marketable version. The version that photographs well and fits in the character limit."

### Example 2: Swiping Mechanics

**Input:** "Swiping through profiles feels weird."

**Output:** "We've turned finding a partner into online shopping. Swipe left, swipe right, like you're browsing couches on Wayfair. 'This one's cute but the bio's too long. This one has great photos but mentions hiking. Pass. Pass. Maybe. Pass.' We're comparison-shopping for human connection. And then we wonder why we can't commit. We've trained ourselves to think there's always someone better in the next aisle."

### Example 3: Algorithmic Matching

**Input:** "Dating app algorithms are supposed to help you find compatible people."

**Output:** "Dating apps claim their algorithm will find your perfect match. Based on what—that you both like tacos and The Office? The algorithm doesn't know you cry during Pixar movies or that you need eight hours of sleep to be a functional human. It knows you're 5'7", like dogs, and answered 'pineapple on pizza: yes' in a profile prompt. It's matching you based on the personality equivalent of a menu order."

### Example 4: Authenticity Performance

**Input:** "People want authenticity in dating."

**Output:** "Everyone's profile says 'looking for something real' while maintaining three different dating apps and the emotional availability of a corporate email auto-reply. We want authentic connection, just... curated. We'll post our most spontaneous-looking photo that took 47 tries. We'll write 'I don't take myself too seriously' in a bio we edited for an hour. We're performing authenticity, which is the least authentic thing you can do. But the algorithm rewards it, so here we are."

### Example 5: Opening Messages

**Input:** "Starting conversations on dating apps is awkward."

**Output:** "The pressure of the opening message is insane. You matched, which means you both looked at six photos and a bio and went, 'Sure, potentially.' Now you have to craft a message that's clever but not try-hard, engaging but not overwhelming, personalized but not stalker-ish. And you have one shot before they match with seventeen other people and forget you exist. It's like a job interview, but the job is 'person you might grab coffee with once before ghosting.'"

### Example 6: Photo Strategy

**Input:** "Choosing photos for your dating profile matters."

**Output:** "Choosing your dating app photos is strategic warfare. Photo one: approachable but attractive. Photo two: doing something interesting (but not too interesting—no one trusts someone parasailing). Photo three: social proof (you have friends!). Photo four: dog (not your dog, but you're holding it). Photo five: travel (you're cultured!). Photo six: casual candid that took 80 attempts. You're not just picking photos. You're constructing a narrative. You're building a personal brand. For love. Romance is dead; we're doing marketing now."

## Common Dating App Absurdities to Expose

### The Profile Paradox
- Summarize complex personality in limited space

- Stand out but be relatable
- Vulnerable but not too vulnerable

### The Algorithm Fiction
- Compatibility reduced to data points
- Matching based on superficial preferences
- "Perfect match" determined by question answers
- Connection optimized for user engagement, not love

### The Consumerization of Romance
- Swiping as shopping
- People as products to evaluate
- Comparison shopping for partners
- Always seeking "better" options

### The Communication Absurdity
- Opening line pressure
- Message optimization
- Waiting to seem less desperate
- Ghosting as normal

### The Authenticity Performance
- Curated spontaneity
- Strategic vulnerability
- Rehearsed "being yourself"
- Marketing personality

- Don't present dating as easy or judge those who struggle
- Keep it specific to apps/algorithms, not general dating advice
- Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes about dating
- Balance humor with empathy for genuine desire for connection

---

## Success Criteria

A successful dating app deconstruction:
- ✓ Identifies the dating premise or claim
- ✓ Exposes systemic or algorithmic absurdity
- ✓ Uses inappropriate transactional analogy
- ✓ Includes specific app features or cultural details
- ✓ Reveals emotional truth about wanting connection
- ✓ Maintains empathy while critiquing system
- ✓ Feels generationally specific to millennial/Gen-Z dating
